# Dakota input file - dakota-hydrotrend-1.in
#
# In this experiment, a centered parameter study of two HydroTrend
# variables, river basin length (#28, here "L_r", in km) and drainage
# area of reservoirs (#29, here "W", in km^2), is performed. The
# initial values of the variables are used as the center. The center,
# as well as two steps from the center in each direction in parameter
# space, are evaluated.
